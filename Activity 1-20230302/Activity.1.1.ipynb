    "#  Activity 1.1: $k$-Nearest Neighbour Classifier\n",
    "Last modified (13 Feb 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, we learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- load and visualise an example dataset via `scikit-learn` and `matplotlib`\n",
    "- split a dataset into train and test set (using `numpy`)\n",
    "- use the `scikit-learn` conventions to call (and implement) a machine learning algorihtm\n",
    "- describe and implement the $k$-NN classifier \n",
    "- compute error rate and confusion matrix for prediction results\n",
    "- plot the effect of the hyper-parameter $k$ on train and test error (using `matplotlib`)\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, we learn how <a href=\"https://saravananthirumuruganathan.wordpress.com/2010/05/17/a-detailed-introduction-to-k-nearest-neighbor-knn-algorithm/\">K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</a> classifier works, which we will use as a vehicle to practice some of the basic concepts of machine learning. KNN is a \"non-parametric\" model, which means that the number of estimated parameters grows with the number of training data points (as opposed to parametric models where the number of parameters is fixed based based on the dimensionality of the input data). \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, KNN is an example of an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance-based_learning\">instance-based</a> supervised learner and a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_learning\">lazy learner</a> that stores all training data points and their labels in memory, and predict the class label for a new data point based on its similarity to the training data.\n",
    "The labels of the stored training data points are considered the parameters of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a training dataset containing $(x_1,t_1), \\dots, (x_N,t_N)$ pairs where $x_N \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ is the input and $t_N \\in \\mathcal{C}$ is the target class label. Given a test data point $x_0$, the $k$-nearest neighbour classifier works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the $k$ data points from the training data that are *nearest* to $x_0$, where we assess closeness/distance by some distance measure, per default the usual Eucledian distance $\\|x_n-x_0\\|$\n",
    "2. Look at the label of the $k$ nearest neighbours and select the label which has the majority vote\n",
    "\n",
    "If the classes are equally common among the neighbours (e.g., two positive and two negative neighbours in binary classification when K=4), the test datapoint is randomly assigned to one of the classes. For example, Figure <strong>A.1</strong> (below) illustrates such situation where the test datapoint (shown by <span style=\"color: #00ff00;\">green</span>) has exactly two neighbours from each class (marked by <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">red</span> and <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">blue</span>).\n",

    "Here, we implement a basic KNN classifier. Note that in Assignment 1, you will be asked to expand this implementation and build a KNN regressor. In this task, we use a simple, yet very popular, dataset to investigate the performance of our KNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the iris dataset and divide it to separate training and testing sets,\n",
    "- Define a function that calculates the majority vote,\n",
    "- Define KNN function that takes training labeled samples, testing samples, $K$ and a distance metric and predicts the class labels for the testing samples,\n",
    "- Apply KNN where for some values of $K$ and report training and testing error\n",
    "- Plot training and testing error versus $1/K$ where $K \\in \\{1,\\cdots,100\\}$"

    "## Loading and Visualising the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use `scikit-learn` to load an example dataset that is quite famous in machine learning and statistics: the [Iris flower dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) that has been published by the famous statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936. Then we will use `matplotlib` to visualise the data as two scatter plots, which is possible because the data only has four input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example datasets in `scikit-learn` can be loaded via the functions in the module `sklearn.datasets` (see also [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html)). Specifically, the functions return `bunch` objects that are dict-like objects containing among others the key/values:\n",

    "- `'target'`: the $n$-vector of labels (target values) coded numerically\n",
    "- `'feature_names`: the names of the input variables\n",
    "- `'target_names'`: the names of the target classes (corresponding to the numerical codes)"
